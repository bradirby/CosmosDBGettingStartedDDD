# Developing a .NET console app using Azure Cosmos DB
This sample shows you how to use the Azure Cosmos DB service to store and access data from a .NET console application using a DDD project structure.

This example was adapted from the Microsoft console app located here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-get-started


## Running this sample

Download the Cosmos Emulator, then install and run it.  The opening page will give you the opportunity to download a sample app.  That is where you can find the local credentials needed for this sample to run.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=cli%2Cssl-netstd21

There are 2 places to put your primary key generated by the emulator, in the App.Config file in the CosmosGettingStartedDDD project, and the unit test.
